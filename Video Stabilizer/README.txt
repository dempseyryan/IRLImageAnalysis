	Q: How do I select my frames?
	A: By clicking image select, you will be prompted to choose both the first and last image in the stack.  
           The starting and ending frames can be adjusted within the same stack using the arrows on the
           bottom right, and the confirmation buttons on the left.  The current selections are shown on the left.
           To pick a new stack, you will have to click image select.

	Q: How do I alternate frames?
	A: Use the 'step size' button to skip frames.  e.g., step size = 1 means that every frame will be used.
           step size = 2 means every second frame will be used.
	
	Q: How do I search with more sensitivity?


	A: PT Threshold can be adjusted in the main window.  It ranges from 0 to 1000.

	Q: How do I change the ROI?
	A: When the ROI button is clicked, the user will be prompted to create a rectangular ROI with the mouse.
